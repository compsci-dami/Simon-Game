# Simon-Game


- **Game Structure:** The code implements the classic Simon game, where players must remember and repeat a sequence of colors.
- **Technologies Used:** The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery for DOM manipulation.
- **Game Logic:**
    - The game uses arrays to store the game pattern and user clicks.
    - It generates random sequences and checks user input against the game pattern.
    - The difficulty increases as the game progresses, adding a new color to the sequence each round.
- **User Interaction:**
    - The game starts when a key is pressed.
    - Players click on colored buttons to repeat the sequence.
    - Visual and audio feedback is provided for each interaction.
- **Game Flow:**
    - The game tracks the current level and updates it as the player progresses.
    - If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and can be restarted.
- **Audio-Visual Elements:** The game includes sound effects and button animations to enhance the user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The HTML structure suggests a responsive layout for different screen sizes.
